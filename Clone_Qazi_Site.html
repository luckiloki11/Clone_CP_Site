        <h1>How To Build your Authority, Overcome Obscurity, Scale Your Business, and Build An Audience of Ideal Buyers For Your Products and Services...</h1>

        <p>Here's where you're at right now.<br>You have a powerful message that you want to share with the world.<br>
        You have a product or service that's successful and gets your customers results.<br>
        But if your people are winning, why aren't you winning on a scale you're supposed to be winning?<br>
        What's stopping you from getting the entire world to know you?</p>
        <p>Your problem is not that your funnel isn't working, you have low conversions, your positioning is off, your copy sucks, or that
        your service isn't valuable</p>
        <p>Your #1 problem is obscurity. Your problem is getting the world to know you, your products, and your services</p>
        <h2>It's time to stop competing and dominate the market</h2><p>But first, let me ask you a question</p><p>When you think
        of entreprenuership... Who's the first guy that comes to mind? (Gary Vee).<br>When you think of sales... Who's the first person that comes to mind? (Grant Cardone).
        <br>When you think of personal development... Who's the first person that comes to mind? (Tony Robbins).<br>... And when you look up
        how to code, you won't get very far without coming across me :).</p><p>Look, you need to be in a place in your market where when
        someone has a need, you're the first and only person that should come to your potential customer's mind</p><p>Now the question is, how do you build that relationship
        with your audience where you're always the first person to come in their mind?</p><p>Let me tell you what won't work<br>Blogging for optimizedkeyword terms or SEO.
        <br>Focusing on the best tags or titles on your YouTube video<br>Going to local networks to pass your business cards</p><p>You already know this, just saying it anyway</p>
        <p>Now, here is what WILL work.<br>First, you need a product or service that the world needs (you already got this part down).<br>
        Second, you need to build trust and an authentic relationship with your audience.</p><p>People like Gary Vee, Grant Cardone, Tony Robbins, or anyone else who's 
        dominating that market for one reason and one reason only. Trust</p><p>They've built businesses that will last the test of time. Even way after they die.</p>    
        <p>Everyone is always looking for a "unique selling proposition". If you have an audience of raving fans that trust you, you don't need to be unique.
        Harley Davidson doesn't need to be unique to sell bikes. Gary Vee just wrote a sequel to "Crush It" called "Crushing It!". Doesn't sound very unique to me.
        But he sold a shit load of copies</p><p>Thats the place I want you to be. In a place where you're the only one who is first and the right choice for your customer.</p>    
        <p>Now, let's say we want to build an authentic connection with our audience and customers... How should we do it? The best way would be to meet these people
        in person. Face to face. Just you and them. They can see your passion, feel your energy, and get their questions answered.</p>
